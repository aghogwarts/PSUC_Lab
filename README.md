# PSUC Codes

This repository contains all the codes for programs done in PSUC class and Labs topic-wise.

---

In all the programs you may see that i've used a `comma(,)` in `scanf` statements and hence while typing in the comamnd line you'll have to put values accordingly.
<br><br>
For example:

```c
scanf("%d,%d", &m, &n);
```

Put values as `4,5`
<br><br>

### Note:

- Every program can have a different implementation but these codes are how I tried to solve the problem statements. Feel free to DM me if you are stuck somewhere and need help!
- If you find problems in any code feel free to open an issue or a Pull Request in the respective tabs!
- Or just head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/aghogwarts/PSUC/discussions) page to discuss anything and everything related to this repository!
  <br><br>
- If you haven't started Learning C or have issues in some topics I recommend watching [this 4 hour](https://youtu.be/87SH2Cn0s9A) video that kind of completely covers programming in C.
